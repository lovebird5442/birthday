              Pipal Chowk is now a sacred memory. That's where the boy and the

            <p>
              Standing near the classroom door, under the CCTV, pretending to be
              casual while my heart was going crazy. It wasn't a fancy café, but
              that little stolen time with you felt more magical than any movie

              The first time I touched your hand, it was cold and nervous — just
              like my heart. From the second time onward, your hand always felt
              warm, like it had already decided to stay with mine.

              Our first movie date at <strong>CG Mall</strong> — not just about
              the film, but about sitting next to you in the dark, sharing
              popcorn, stealing glances, and realizing how right it felt to be

              I still remember the way my heart stopped when you finally said
              those three magical words: <strong>"I love you too."</strong> From
              that moment, the story stopped being one-sided — it became our
              story.

                A normal school day that secretly changed everything. A boy in

                Talking more. Laughing more. Sharing songs, secrets, and small
                pieces of our worlds. Somewhere between jokes and late-night

              <p>
                We fell in love properly – with butterflies, overthinking, and a
                thousand screenshots of our chats. We also had our first
                misunderstandings, our first real fights, and we started to
                learn that love is not like Romeo and Juliet – it's not about a
                dramatic end, it's about staying and working through the pain.

                Life started pulling us in different directions. New classes,
                new responsibilities, new versions of ourselves. But even when
                time and distance tried to come between us, we kept finding our
                way back—proof that our story was stronger than every "what if".

              <p>
                You stepped into BSc Nursing – into a world of books, sleepless
                nights, practicals, and patients. While you learned to care for
                the world, I watched you grow into a woman I admire deeply, and

                We had days like fairy tales and days that felt like storms. We
                argued, cried, doubted, and still held on. Through every high
                and low, every break and every healing, I kept realizing: my
                favorite decision in this life is still you, Ayushma.

              <p>
                The way your whole face lights up when you’re genuinely happy,
                like the sun decided to live in your cheeks for a while.

                That laugh that makes everyone else laugh too, even if they
                don’t know why. It’s my favorite sound in the world.

                love all of it.

                You don’t just say “I love you”, you show it—in the patience,
                the softness, the way you stay, even when it’s not easy.

          If I could, I’d write this on paper and fold it into a thousand tiny
          hearts. For now, I’ll write it here and hope you feel every word.
        </p>

        <div class="letter-wrapper">
          <div class="letter-header">
            <div class="letter-to">To my 20-year-old angel, Ayushma Regmi,</div>
            <div class="letter-date">us • year 6</div>
          </div>

          <div class="letter-body" id="letterBody">
            <p class="letter-line">
              Thank you—for walking into my life back when I was a class 10 boy
              and you were a class 9 girl, and somehow deciding to stay. Thank
              you for every smile in the corridors, every silly chat, every late
              night when we stayed awake just to hear each other’s voice a
              little longer.
            </p>
            <p class="letter-line">
              I’m sorry—for the times I hurt you, for the moments I didn’t
              listen well enough, for the days when my anger, ego, or silence
              made you feel alone. There were ups and downs, breaks and storms,
              but even when we were apart in words, my heart never stopped
              holding you.
            </p>
            <p class="letter-line">
              I admire you—for choosing BSc Nursing, for carrying the weight of
              your books, your shifts, your family, your own battles, and still
              finding a way to love me. You’re like those heroines from stories—
              strong like the women who stand beside their kings, gentle like
              Juliet’s first confession, but wiser because you choose life,
              healing, and growth over tragedy.
            </p>
            <p class="letter-line">
              When I think of great loves—Romeo and Juliet, Jack and Rose, Shah
              Jahan and Mumtaz, Heer and Ranjha, Laila and Majnu—I realize
              something: their stories were beautiful, but they ended. I don’t
              want a love that burns out dramatically. I want this quiet,
              stubborn love we have, the one that survives misunderstandings,
              distance, overthinking, and still finds its way back.
            </p>
            <p class="letter-line">
              You deserve the gentlest kind of love—the kind that doesn’t rush
              you, doesn’t “fix” you, but sits next to you in your fears, holds
              your hand through anxiety, and waits patiently while you figure
              yourself out. That’s the love I want to give you, not just on your
              20th birthday, but in every ordinary day that comes after.
            </p>
            <p class="letter-line">
              Thank you for six years of growing, fighting, learning, healing,
              laughing, and loving with me. For all the times life tried to pull
              us apart and we still chose to stand on the same side. I don’t
              know the exact shape of our future, but I know this much with
              certainty: if life is a story, then you, Ayushma Regmi, are and
              will always be my favorite chapter.
